    I mostly use this blog as a way to show some of the underlying math that
    occurs 'under the hood' when a statistical model is fit to data with a
    little more detail (i.e., steps) than I've seen elsewhere. This should
    (hopefully) make it a little easier to understand and interpret the output
    of a given model when conducting different analyses.

    <h4><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h4>

  {% endif %} {% endfor %}
